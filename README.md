## Course outline

### Session 1: Basic data analysis in *R* 
###### (8:30 am to 12:00 pm)

The goal of the morning session is to give a short introduction into the basics of *R* and the *Rstudio* environment. At what level we will start this introduction strongly depends on the background and programming experience of the participants. Due to the limited time please only expect a very short introduction. The larger share of the morning session is reserved for our small practical example where we analyze a small data set and visualize our results. In *R* there are usually many ways to perform the same task (e.g. *base* plotting or *ggplot*). I will demonstrate here was is often called the *"tidy"* way of data analysis in *R*.

###### The morning in bullets:
- R basics (depending on the background of the participants)
- Basic data analysis using the tidyverse
- Data analysis and visualization using the ‘tidyverse’ based on a practical example.



### Session 2: SWAT simulation, calibration, and sensitivity analysis in *R* 
###### (1:00 pm to 4:30pm)
